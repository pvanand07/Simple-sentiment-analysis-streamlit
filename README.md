This is a simple sentiment analysis app that uses the Transformers pipeline and Streamlit to analyze the sentiment of text input by a user. The app allows users to enter some text and click a button to perform sentiment analysis. The sentiment analysis pipeline uses a pre-trained model to classify the sentiment of the input text as positive or negative and return a confidence score. The app displays the sentiment and confidence score to the user.
